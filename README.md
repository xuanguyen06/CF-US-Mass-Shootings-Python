## Project Overview
The number of mass shootings in the United States have been increasing within the last few years. This has been a hot top amongst news organizations and politicians. This case study was developed to explore the distribution of mass shootings across the United States. 

## Key Questions and Objectives
What state has the highest amount of mass shootings?
Which city/county has the highest amount of mass shootings?
How does the distribution of mass shootings vary across states?
Do certain regions have a higher risk?

## US Mass Shootings Dataset
The dataset used is collected by the Gun Violence Archive (GVA), whose mission is to document incidents of gun violence and gun crime nationally to provide independent, verified data to those who need to use it in their research, advocacy, or writing. The data contains mass shooting incidents within the United States from 2014 to 2023.
